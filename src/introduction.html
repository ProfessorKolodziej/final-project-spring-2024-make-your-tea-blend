		<h1>Before we start...</h1>
        <p>
            Tea makers blend various ingredients to create unique teas that we come to love and enjoy. Artisan blenders take things a step further and create tea blends that are proprietary to a tea brand or for individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can create your own tea blend based on several choices of teas, infusions, herbs and spices. You can get as wild and funky as you want; however, the flavor is the end goal in any blend creation.
        </p>
        <p>
            I will guide you through creating your one and only tea blend, step by step.
